# Backtest
I wrote this notebook in order to backtest a stock trading idea I had. From the results, I didn't do that well compared to the Buy-and-hold strategy. However, I really enjoyed messing around with this code. There were a few times when I got insane returns like turning the intial $100 into 26 million in the course of 18 years. I am glad I ran into this because it helped me learn that I shouldn't always trust my results. 

Requirements: 
- In order to run the code, you will need to get an alpha vantage key and a quandl key.
- https://www.alphavantage.co/ and https://docs.quandl.com/
